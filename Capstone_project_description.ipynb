No wonder the real estate market there is one of the most affordable and provides value for the owne)rs. \nA quick search can show us the venues can vary by a large margin from neighborhoods to neighborhoods. For example, venues in midtown can cost a millions dollars and has many upscale restaurants and shops; while in suburbs like Alpharetta, Johns creek, Cumming which are just 45 minutes away, it will have cheaper housing available and more affordable restaurants and venues.\n\nSo what features of a neighborhood are similar and what are different to such extend? One hypothesis is that the surrounding venues can be a decision factor.\nAnyone who has attempted to find an home to rent or buy, has seen advertisements such as: This condo is located near the subway station, malls, supermarkets, university etc. And it's likely that the price will be higher than others with locations not as \"convenient\".\nCan the venues surrounding an accommodation effect its price? And what kind of venues can effect the most? And by what weight? We will visualize and analyse the major suburban areas in Atlanta.\n\n"
